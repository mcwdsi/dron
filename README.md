# This repository is the official repository for the Drug Ontology #

This site supports the development of the Drug Ontology, a formal ontology of drugs created at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and now developed and maintained at the Medical College of Wisconsin.

The original use cases for this ontology included comparative effectiveness research and research into drug-induced liver injury.

The original issue tracker for this project remains located [here](https://ontology.atlassian.net/browse/DRON).
